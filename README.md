# SimonsVoss-Challenge

* For this challenge, I used Swift as the programming language and made an iOS App in Xcode.

* The architecture I've used is MVVM (on the UI) + Services and Dependency Injection everywhere; Protocol Oriented Programming to be able to use Mocks when creating tests. I used UIKit for the UI Components. A UIViewController subclass with a top UISearchBar for the Lock items display. And a UITableViewController for the Search Results items display.

* I used Async / Await APIs, and error handling on each layer.

The app has no external dependencies and should be able to run in the Xcode Simulator as is.
